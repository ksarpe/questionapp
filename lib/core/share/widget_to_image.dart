/// The widget is laid out and painted in a throwaway render tree that is never
/// attached to the live [WidgetsBinding] — so nothing flashes on screen and the
/// capture doesn't depend on the widget being mounted/visible. Fonts already
/// loaded by the running app (the bundled `Anton` family, the Material icon
/// font) are available to the render, so the result looks identical to what the
/// same widget would draw on screen.
///
/// [logicalSize] is the child's size in logical pixels; the PNG is
/// [logicalSize] × [pixelRatio] device pixels (e.g. 360×640 @ 3 ⇒ 1080×1920),
/// which is why the same render doubles as high-res store-screenshot art.
///
/// [view] anchors the render tree to a real [ui.FlutterView]; pass
/// `View.of(context)` from a mounted widget (or `tester.view` in tests).
///
/// Returns null only if the platform fails to encode the image; the caller is
/// expected to fall back to a non-image path rather than surface an error.
