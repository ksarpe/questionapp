/// timeout, a dropped HTTP connection — as "offline" so callers can fall back to
/// the local cache and the UI can show a calm "you're offline" message instead
/// of surfacing a raw `PostgrestException` / `ClientException`.
///
/// A real 4xx/5xx the server actually returned is deliberately NOT offline: the
/// request reached the backend, so the caller should treat it as a true error
/// (it carries a status/code, and its text won't match the transport keywords
/// below). When in doubt we err towards "not offline" so genuine errors are
/// never silently masked by stale cache.
