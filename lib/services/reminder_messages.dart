/// Picks the text for one daily-reminder fire from a pool, so the user can't
/// predict which nudge they'll get, and switches on local state so someone who
/// already voted today is teased about the outcome instead of told to "go vote".
///
/// Pure + synchronous by design: everything it needs — the streak / grace window
/// from the last cached [UserStats] sync, whether today's daily is already
/// voted, and the split the user landed on — is read by the caller straight from
/// SharedPreferences and passed in. That keeps selection unit-testable and the
/// scheduler free of l10n concerns, and matches the local-only model (the body
/// is baked at schedule time; nothing runs when the notification actually fires).
///
/// [isToday] marks the nearest fire (today's slot). Only it may use the
/// time-sensitive hooks (grace countdown, exact streak day) and the post-vote
/// branch — for future days in the loop we can't know the state yet, so they
/// fall back to the evergreen "come and vote" pool.
